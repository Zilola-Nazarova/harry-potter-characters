## 🤝 Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcomed!

Currently, I have to hardcode a database of mountain peaks with following information:
- name
- elevation
- coordinates

Due to lack of time I was only able to add few mountains, so I would appreciate if anyone shared a complete database of mountain peaks located in Uzbekistan.
